Welcome to DankRPG's official documentation.

DankRPG is a Discord bot that allows you to play RPG games in your Discord server. This documentation is to help you get started with DankRPG.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to invite DankRPG to your server. You can do this by clicking [here](https://dankrpg.xyz/invite).

Once you have invited DankRPG to your server, you can start playing RPG games. To start playing, you need to start a profile. You can do this by running the slash command `/start`.

## FAQ/Help:

### Why slash commands?

DankRPG used to use a customizable prefix-based system. However, this system requires access to the "Message Content" intent, which is not ideal for user privacy. We understand that slash commands are not ideal for everyone. You may view Discord's FAQ on slash commands [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ), if necessary.

### All my data has been reset! (past users)

DankRPG has recently been re-written from scratch. This means that all data has to have been reset. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused, and this will not happen again in the future.

### How do I know DankRPG is safe/respecting my privacy?

DankRPG's code is open-source. You can view the source code [here](https://github.com/Snoozeds/DankRPG), and you can view our Privacy Policy [here](https://dankrpg.xyz/privacy).<br></br>
You can also run DankRPG yourself if you wish.
