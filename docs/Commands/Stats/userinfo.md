Params: &lt;user&gt;

Displays information about you/another user.

Includes:
- Name, Discriminator, ID
- Avatar (if present)
- Banner (if present)
- Commands used
- Account creation date
- Account join (server) date
- Roles

## Issues:
- Because of how Discord handles user banners, if a user applies a banner, but then cancels their Nitro subscription, the banner will still be returned. This is a Discord issue, and cannot be fixed by the bot.
