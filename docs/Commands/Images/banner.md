Params: &lt;user&gt; (optional)

Will return an image of the given user's banner/your own banner. <br />
You can view the original image by clicking the image, and selecting "View Original". <br />
If the user has never had a banner, it will instead return their accent color (banner color).

## Issues:
- Because of how Discord handles user banners, if a user applies a banner, but then cancels their Nitro subscription, the banner will still be returned. This is a Discord issue, and cannot be fixed by the bot.
