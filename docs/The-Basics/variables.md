# Common Variables
Dank RPG uses multiple "variables", these store information. The most common are:
- **Coins** - DankRPG's currency, usually defined by a coin emoji. This currency can be used for buying items, upgrades, heals, etc.
- **MegaCoins** - Currency that is more valuable than coins. You gain them daily by buying the "Daily MC" upgrade in "d!megashop".
- **ATK** - Attack, currently does nothing! **Plans to integrate this with Dungeon and MegaCoins soon...**
- **HP** - This is how much health a user has left, defined by a heart emote. If you run out of HP you die and lose your common variables.
- **MaxHP** - The max amount of health you can heal to. Can be upgraded with hpDrops from `d!shop`.
