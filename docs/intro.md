# The Basics:

## Variables
Dank RPG uses multiple "variables", these store information. They are:
- `Coins` - DankRPG's currency, usually defined by a coin emoji. This currency can be used for buying items, upgrades, heals, etc.
- `ATK` - Attack, this is what makes the command `fight` harder. The higher attack you have, the more coins you gain. However, you lose more HP.
- `HP` - Health, this is how much health a user has left, defined by a heart emote. If you run out of HP, you die, and lose all your coins, and ATK.
