# Server Settings
:::tip
'd!' refers to the default prefix. This can be changed, so check by pinging DankRPG first.

## Defining server settings:
Server settings are different per server, and may apply to all users of that server. By default, these settings can only be changed by users with the 'Manage Server' permission. However, this can be changed below. You can see a server's settings by running `d!serversettings`.

### Setting the prefix:
`d!prefix <prefix>` <br />
This command changes the prefix of DankRPG. This cannot be set to blank. By default, the prefix is `d!`.

### Permissions:
`d!permissions <manageserver/admin>` <br />
This command changes the permission required to change server settings, and use admin commands (addcoins, removecoins). By default, this is set to 'Manage Server'. Make sure to give permissions to users you trust, as this can be a potentially dangerous setting to change.
